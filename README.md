# PythonAudio
ZackAudio is a wrapper for pyaudio that lets you store audio clips and play them without interacting with pyaudio directly
Synthesizer has a means to create sounds with any frequency function, amplitude function, duration, etc. It gives you access to basic wavetables such as sin, saw, square, triangle, and white noise. There is also a way to add signals together on top of each other, and one after the other. You can also create harmonic series textures by specifying a list of amplitudes for each frequency, as well as the base frequency.
